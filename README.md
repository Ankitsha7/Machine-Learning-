This is Supervised Learning
Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where a model learns from labelled dataâ€”meaning every input has a corresponding correct output. The model makes predictions and compares them with the true outputs, adjusting itself to reduce errors and improve accuracy over time. The goal is to make accurate predictions on new, unseen data. For example, a model trained on images of handwritten digits can recognise new digits it has never seen before
