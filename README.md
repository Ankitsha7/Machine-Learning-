Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where a model learns from labelled dataâ€”meaning every input has a corresponding correct output. The model makes predictions and compares them with the true outputs, adjusting itself to reduce errors and improve accuracy over time. The goal is to make accurate predictions on new, unseen data. For example, a model trained on images of handwritten digits can recognise new digits it has never seen before.

Types of Supervised Learning in Machine Learning
Now, Supervised learning can be applied to two main types of problems:

Classification: Where the output is a categorical variable (e.g., spam vs. non-spam emails, yes vs. no).
Regression: Where the output is a continuous variable (e.g., predicting house prices, stock prices).
